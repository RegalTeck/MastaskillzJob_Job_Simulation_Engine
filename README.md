# MastaSkillz – Job Simulation Engine (Probation Task)

This is the MVP implementation of a Job Simulation Engine for MastaSkillz. It dynamically generates tiered, role-based simulation tasks and validates submissions based on task type (code, document). The system supports both backend logic and a polished frontend demo.

Features

Dynamic task generation using FastAPI
Unified skill taxonomy (`role_tasks.json`)
Role-based simulations with 4 tiers: Beginner → Expert
Code validation using `pytest` with autogenerated test cases
Document validation using NLP similarity scoring (`difflib`)
Supports `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` uploads
Swagger API docs (`/docs`) with curl-ready testing
Next.js frontend at `/simulator`
Landing page at `/` with animation and glassmorphism
